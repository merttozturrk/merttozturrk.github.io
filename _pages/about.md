My name is Mert Ozturk and I'm currently continuing my M.Sc. in Data Science at [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/). I received my undergraduate degree in Statistics from [Middle East Technical University](https://www.metu.edu.tr/) My research interests are natural language processing and sentiment analysis of social media data. Currently, I am a member of [VRL Lab](http://varollab.com/index.html) and working with [Onur Varol](http://www.onurvarol.com/) about sentiment analysis of Turkish Twitter users.
